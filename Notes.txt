***GIT Seminar w/Paul***

version control system used to track any file. Most notably used in development
Git commits are checksummed using SHA-1 meaning no corrupt files without knowing about it.

Three states of GIT
- modified
file changed, but it has not been committed (ex: normal work, or saving)
- staging
files that are marked to go into the next commit snapshot (utilizing git add script.js)
-commit stage
data safely stored in the local database (such as vm box, docker, computer, etc.)

to start version track/control
"git init"
creates new project
your project should never be inside another project folder in order to avoid inverse tre tracking issues

stage our files for a commit
"git add <file>"

use "git status" to check on file staging

to commit your files, use "git commit -m "<your message>"", command.

to create new branch -- git branch <new_branch_name>

"git branch <new_branch_name>" creates a new branch and that's it

"git checkout -b <new_branch_name>" creates a new branch and switches to that branch.

to switch between branches, use "git checkout <branch name>"

to delete a branch, use "git branch -D <branch_name>"

to unstage a commit, use "git reset <file_name>"
to remove an entire commit, use "git rest --hard <commit hash BEFORE the one you want removed>

to add remote branch
    check if any exist using "git remote -v"
    if none exist, and you've created a repo on github
    run "git remote add <name_of_remote_stream> <github url>

to push to github
    "git push <name_of_remote_stream> <name_of_branch>
    you must sit on the branch that you are pushing up
